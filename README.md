## Introduction

The customer churn prediction project utilizes machine learning algorithms to identify customers who are likely to churn, i.e., stop using a product or service. By analyzing historical customer data, the project aims to predict churn behavior and implement targeted retention strategies to reduce customer attrition.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: 
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-churn-prediction.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd customer-churn-prediction 
```
3. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Usage

1. Prepare the data:
* Collect customer data including demographic information, transaction history, and usage patterns.

* Preprocess the data by cleaning, transforming, and encoding categorical variables as necessary.

2. Train the models:
* Select the appropriate machine learning algorithms for customer churn prediction, such as logistic regression, random forests, or gradient boosting.

* Split the data into training and testing sets.

* Train the models using the training data.
  
3. Evaluate the models:
* Evaluate the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score.
* Compare the performance of different models and select the best-performing one for customer churn prediction.

4. Predict customer churn:
* Use the trained models to predict the likelihood of churn for new, unseen customer data.
* Identify customers with a high likelihood of churn and implement targeted retention strategies, such as personalized offers or proactive customer support.

# Data Collection
The project requires customer data to train and test the models. Ensure that the data is obtained from reliable sources and complies with privacy and security regulations. Examples of datasets for customer churn prediction include customer relationship management (CRM) databases or subscription-based service records.

# Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a crucial step in preparing the data for machine learning. It involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, normalizing the features, and encoding categorical variables. Implement the necessary preprocessing steps based on the characteristics of the data and the requirements of the chosen machine learning algorithms.

# Model Training
Select the appropriate machine learning algorithms for customer churn prediction. Commonly used algorithms include logistic regression, random forests, gradient boosting, or support vector machines. Train the models using the preprocessed data and tune the hyperparameters to optimize performance.

# Model Evaluation 
Evaluate the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score. Compare the performance of different models and select the best-performing one for customer churn prediction. Consider the business requirements and cost of false positives and false negatives in determining the optimal churn prediction model.

# Results
Present the results of the customer churn prediction models. Include metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score, to evaluate the model's performance. Discuss the effectiveness of the models in predicting customer churn and any insights gained from the analysis.
